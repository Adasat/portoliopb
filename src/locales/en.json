  "description": "ABOUT ME",
  "about": [
    "I’m a <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> passionate about building <strong>intuitive, high-performance web applications</strong>. My expertise spans both <strong>frontend</strong> and <strong>backend</strong> development, allowing me to craft solutions that are as <strong>scalable</strong> as they are <strong>user-friendly</strong>.",
    "On the <strong>backend</strong>, I work with <strong>relational (MySQL) and non-relational (MongoDB) databases</strong>, designing efficient data structures and ensuring smooth data flow. On the <strong>frontend</strong>, I primarily develop with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Vue</strong>, leveraging modern frameworks to create <strong>dynamic and maintainable user interfaces</strong>. While my personal portfolio is built with <strong>Astro</strong>, I’m always exploring new technologies to refine my workflow and optimize <strong>performance</strong>.",
    "I’ve developed <strong>web apps for EV charging stations, interactive geolocation maps, and event management platforms</strong>, as well as led <strong>redesigns and maintenance for educational websites</strong> and built <strong>custom WordPress solutions</strong> for industries like <strong>pharmaceuticals</strong> and <strong>the arts</strong>. Each project has deepened my understanding of <strong>usability, performance</strong>, and how to bridge <strong>technology with real-world impact</strong>.",
    "Beyond development, I have a deep appreciation for <strong>UX/UI design</strong>—while it’s not my main focus, I always prioritize <strong>usability, accessibility, and thoughtful interactions</strong> in my work.",
    "When I’m not coding, I’m usually playing football, gaming (both video games and board games), or reading. I thrive on <strong>problem-solving</strong>, whether it’s <strong>debugging</strong> a tricky piece of code or figuring out the best strategy in a game."
